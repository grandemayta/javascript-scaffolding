# Scaffolding Vanilla JS

SPA Scaffolding build with Vanilla JS and lit-html as a template engine. To navigate between pages I added navigo router. This application works with latest Major Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and Opera).

**NB: If you need support for IE11 you can replace lit-html with another template engine like pug.**

Keep calm and code!
