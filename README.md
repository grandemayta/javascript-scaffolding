# Scaffolding Vanilla JS

Single Page Appilcaton Scaffolding build with Vanilla JS and lit-html as a template engine. To navigate between pages I added a tiny navigo router library.

** NB: If you need support for IE11 you can replace lit-html with another template engine like pug. **

Keep calm and code!
