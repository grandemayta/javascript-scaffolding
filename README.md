# Javacript Scaffolding

SPA Scaffolding build with Vanilla JS and pug as a template engine. To navigate between pages I added navigo router. This application works with latest Major Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera and IE11).
You can use latest features of es6 and es7 without add manually the polyfills.

## Launch the application

```sh
npm install
```

```sh
npm start
```

## Release in Production

```sh
npm run prod
```
