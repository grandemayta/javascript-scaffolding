# Scaffolding Vanilla JS

SPA Scaffolding build with Vanilla JS and pug as a template engine. To navigate between pages I added navigo router. This application works with latest Major Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge and Opera).

**NB: If you don't need support for IE11 you can try the master branch that include lit-html.**

Keep calm and code!
